With program hierarchy
    want to make the disk seem faster

Will everything be copied in every memory?
    Yes
    - not a problem because the principle of locality
    
Handling Stores with    WRITE-THROUGH


WRITE-THROUGH
    Write buffer
        stops CPU from stalling
    Write buffer myay have multiple entries to absorb bursts of writes
    What if store misses in chache?
        Nothing
    Basically write through the cache to main memory.

    Write through policy:
        - write buffer
        - buffer updates memeory in parallel, so you don't have to wait



Handling Stores with Write-Back cache
    Not going to write immediately to memeory
    Write Back Policy:
        write only to cache and then write chache block back to memory when evict block from cache
        - writes collected in cache, only single write to memeory per block. 

    "Dirty" bit 
        a second bit, that differentiates:
            did I write to this line while in cache or was it clean?
                clean = version in memory same
        if clean, do Nothing
        if dirty, then send to memory to update to newest version
