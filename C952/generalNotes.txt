Pipelining
******************************

Clock rate is CYCLES / SECONDS which is in Hz and is 1/period

Pipelining 
    - doesn't help latency of a single task
    - throughput is improved 

What is the biggest speedup you can do?
    - depends on number of stages
    - takes time for pipe to fill up

Peak speed of 4 loads = factor of *4

Pipeline rate limited by slowest pipeline stage

Unbalanced pipeline 
    - creates limits on the slowest pipeline
    - breaking up assembly line evenly
