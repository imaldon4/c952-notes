The 3C's
******************************
Understanding cache misses

compulsory miss
    - starting a program
    - has to go to memory to put into cache 
    - difficult to avoid, obviously, but small effect
    - solution: increase block size
        will increase miss penalty

capacity miss 
    - cache doesn't have capacity to hold all data working on
    - solution: increase cache size
        will slow access time

conflict/collision miss 
    - multiple memory mapped to same location in cache
    - solution:
        1 - increase cache size 
        2 - increase associativity 
            may increase access time (AND gates and mux from previous slide)


How to calculate 3C's
******************************
Must use a simulator 

1. compulsory
    do {
        set cache size to infinity
        then see number of misses 

2 capacity
    do {
        change cache size from infinity
        then in powers of 2
        count misses for each reduction
    }

3 conflict
    do {
        change from fully associative 
        to n-way associativity
        count misses
        - fully associative, 16-way, 8-way, 4-way, 2-way, 1-way
    }
