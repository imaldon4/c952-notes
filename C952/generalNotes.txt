Example is a directly mapped cache


Cache is meant to be
    programmer invisible

Line and block is used interchangeably
    one entry in the cache

four words = 16 bytes
1 word = 4 bytes


Multiword-block direct-mapped cache
    - spatial locality
    - even if a miss, you still might use the words brought in 

x86 is 64 bytes
    64 bytes at a time are brought into the cache at a time!

Fully associative
    Block can go anywhere
