Caches Part 2
******************************
Cache controller
    looks at 32 bits that come in and splits up the address
    3 fields
        tag
            - remaining portion of processor address to use to find in cache
        index
            - seletcts set
        offset
            - which piece of block to return to processor
            - doesn't play a central role in Cache
        
Cache terms:

HIT RATE: fraction of accesses that hit in the cache
    fration of instruction fetches
    number hits / total number of accesses

MISS RATE:  opposite
    1 - hit RATE

MISS PENALTY: time to replace block from level in memeory hierarchy to cache 

HIT TIME: time to access cache mememory (including tag comparison)
