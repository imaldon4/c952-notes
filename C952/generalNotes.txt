The CPU
******************************
Processor (CPU)
    - datapath (wide words and storage)
    - control (tells it what to do)

Five statges of Instruction execution
    1 instruction fetch
    2 instruction decode
    3 ALU
    4 memory access
    5 register write

Instruction Fetch 
    32-bit instruction fetched from cache-memory hierarchy
    increment PC (PC = PC + 4) pointing to next instruction

Instruction decode
    is it an add, sub, jump?
    gather rdata from fields
    - first read opcode
    - second figure out needed registers
        -which registers   
        -how many registers need to read

ALU
    real work done here
    - shifting, arithmetic, logic, comparisons
    - loads and stores (add needed to get to circuitry)

Memory access
    read values from caches and return to processors

Register write
    result is written to a destination register 
    happens at end of execution
    - arithmetic, logical, shifts, loads, slt
    - stores, branches, jumps?
        store doesn't do anything during this phase, because it has done its work during previous stage
