Pipelining
******************************

Clock rate is CYCLES / SECONDS which is in Hz and is 1/period

Pipelining 
    - doesn't help latency of a single task
    - throughput is improved 

What is the biggest speedup you can do?
    - depends on number of stages
    - takes time for pipe to fill up

Peak speed of 4 loads = factor of *4

Pipeline rate limited by slowest pipeline stage

Unbalanced pipeline 
    - creates limits on the slowest pipeline
    - breaking up assembly line evenly


Pipeline registers
******************************
The registers break the flow of signals

Need registers between stages
    to hold info produced in previous cycle 

Keep the register you need to write to until the end of the pipeline,
then when you get to the end, it will write to the correct register
without overwriting anything else.
