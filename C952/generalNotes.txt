Improving Cache performance
******************************

Reduce time to hit the Cache      
    smaller Cache

Reduce miss rate
    bigger cache 

Reduce miss penalty
    use multiple cache levels


Impact of Larger cache on AMAT
1) Reduce misses 
    capacity misses
    conflict misses
2) longer access time   
    hit time goes up
    two clock cycles in stead of one (possibly)
    clock cycle time might get longer (frequency changes)
