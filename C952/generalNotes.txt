Anatomy of 16 byte cache


Cache Replacement

Block must be aligned in memory


4 byte block to match word size

Simpler ->
    Ask 4 byte boundaries to be aligned in memory
    - 00 always last two bits address
        - compare 30 bits, so two fewer bits 
    
Anatomy of 32B cache, 8 byte block
    - 3 bits of addresses always 000
    - tags have even numbered words
