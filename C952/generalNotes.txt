The CPU
******************************
Processor (CPU)
    - datapath (wide words and storage)
    - control (tells it what to do)

Five statges of Instruction execution
    1 instruction fetch
    2 instruction decode
    3 ALU
    4 memory access
    5 register write

Instruction Fetch 
    32-bit instruction fetched from cache-memory hierarchy
    increment PC (PC = PC + 4) pointing to next instruction

Instruction decode
    is it an add, sub, jump?
    gather rdata from fields
    - first read opcode
    - second figure out needed registers
