Synchronous Digital Systems
******************************
Hardware Design
- End of Moore's law, you want to be able to understand the next generation of Hardware.
- Upsurge of hardware Design
- Companies -> specializing in chips, and need hardware designers 

Basics:

Synchronous:
    - guided by a clock
        orchestrates all behavior
Digital:
    - represent values by discrete values
    - ONLY binary

Switches

Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
CMOS transistors
    - On if control terminal is a 1

Three terminals:
-source
-gate
-drain

n-channel transistor 
    - gate closed with voltage
    - 1 = connected
    - 0 = disconnected

p-channel transistor
    - gate opened with voltage (NOT)
    - 1 = disconnected
    - 0 = connected
