Example is a directly mapped cache


Cache is meant to be
    programmer invisible

Line and block is used interchangeably
    one entry in the cache

four words = 16 bytes
1 word = 4 bytes


Multiword-block direct-mapped cache
    - spatial locality
    - even if a miss, you still might use the words brought in 

x86 is 64 bytes
    64 bytes at a time are brought into the cache at a time!

Fully associative
    - block can go anywhere
    - entire cache is searched
    - needs separate comparator (every entry needs a comparator for parallel compare)

Direct mapped   
    - block goes in one place
    - 1 comparator only
    - numberr of sets = number of blocks

N-way set associative
    - some number of sets and within every set is FULLY associative
    - a combination
    - two way, one way
        set index + several ways of accessing
    
IBM cache terminology
    - calls ways sets and sets ways
