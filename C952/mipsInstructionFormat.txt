Big Idea: --> Stored-Program Computer
******************************
    - Instructions => bits and patterns

Consequence #1: => Everything Addressed
    -Everything has a memory address 
    -Program Counter (PC) => pointer to memory instruction 
        (Intel name: Instruction Pointer)
    
x86 is old and complex
    - Intel old
    - variable length instructions
MIPs Instruction set 
MIPs is newer and less complicated
    - ALL instructions = 32 bits

Fields (MIPS)
    - Operands (Add, etc)
    - Operations

Types: r i j
i format - immediates
