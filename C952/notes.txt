SIMD Architectures
******************************
Data level parallel machines

Data Parallelism:
    executing same operation on multiple data streams

Improves:
    multiplications are independent
    
    pipelining / concurrency in memory access as well



Vector instructions:
    working on multiple instructions at the same time

Programmer's job to make vectors
    avoids stalls exe


Intel SIMD extensions
******************************
Adding mmx instructions to architecture 
    MMX = multi media extensions
        watch videos
Took floating point registers (64 bit)
    consider to be broken up into two 32-bit, or 4 16-bit, etc.

SSE 
    streaming SIMD extensions 
    128-bit registers 

AVX 
    advanced vector extensions 
    256-bit registers 
    - space expansion to 1024-bit registers 
    multiple elements tied together into larger bit registers
