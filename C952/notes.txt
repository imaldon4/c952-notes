Replacement Policy
******************************
Why does associative cache need a replacement policy?

Direct mapped only has one place, no choice to be made. 
Only need replacement policy when ther eare multiple ways.

Random 

LRU 
    exploit temporal locality

FIFO / Round-robin
    - highly associative caches 
    - picking the wrong one will only result a few more misses

NMRU
    - not the one just touched, pick one after that

Second-order effect
    - assuming that most of the time you will get a hit
