Using Parallelism for Performance
******************************
Two ways:
    - multiprogramming 
        run multiple programs in parallel
        easy
    - parallel computing
        run one program faster
        hard




Flynn Taxonomy
******************************





Single-Instruction / Single-Data Stream (SISD)
******************************
One instruction working at one data operand at a time

Single instruciton working at multiple data items at a time

One instruction doing multiple data units of work

SIMD
    instruction pool working on multiple same instrucitons

MIMD
multiple instruction / multiple data streams
    single chip, multiple processors working together


MISD
multiple instrucation / single data stream 
    one data item, and do two instructions on same data item
    not useful
