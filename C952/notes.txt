Data-level Parallelism and SIMD


Use loops:

for (i = 1000; i > 0; i = i - 1){
    x[i] = x[i] + 1;
}

Unroll loop:
    do more than one within a loop 

Note that they use a larger offset

Compliers will automatically perform:
    loop unrolling


for (i = 1000; i > 0; i = i - 4){
    x[i]    = x[i] +s;
    x[i - 1] = x[i - 1] + s;
    x[i - 2] = x[i - 2] + s;
}

Not a good idead to do it that way
Leave it to the compiler
