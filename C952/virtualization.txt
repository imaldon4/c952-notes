Trap handling in 5-stage pipeline
******************************
Interrupts

Exceptions
    PC address Exceptions
    Illegal opcode Exceptions
    Overflow Exceptions
    Data address Exceptions

--> Asynchronous interrupts 

What happens with multiple simultaneous exceptions 
in different pipeline stages?

Service which first?

    DATA ADDRESS EXCEPTION 

Data address exceptions is the latest exception in pipeline

Do the oldest instructions first 
    That exception is the first place that goes wrong and 
    everything else is a consequence of it.


Want to report exceptions in same as if done in program order.

Commit Point
******************************
Save exceptions until Commit

first {
    Flush pipeline of all things behind commit point 
} then {
    change PC to EPC 
}
