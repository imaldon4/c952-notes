Traps / Interrupts / Execeptions
- altering the normal flow control

Load from virtual memory address:
    many steps before redoing load instruction
    
Trap handling:
    - some event happens (interrupt, exception)
    - jump to other piece of code
    - PC gets changed

    external or internal event


Terminology:
    Interrupt - something outside of current program
        asynchronously
        seeking processes' attention
        key on keyboard, mouse activity
        I/O device
        Unrelated to program currently running

    exception - something to do with an instuction in program
        synchronously
        page fault
        related to code you are running
        illegal instruction

    trap - action of servicing that event (an interrupt or exception)
        trap handler will deal with the event

Precise Traps 
    stopping cleanly on ONE instruction
    looks like a clean break

    EPC (exception PC) - the trap handler points to

    save all state registers and error PC, then continue

    interupt handler doesn't need to understand underlying pipeline

    precise traps are tricking in pipelined superscalar out-of-order processor!
